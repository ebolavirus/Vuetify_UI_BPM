# vuetify-dialog-promise

A Promise API for [Vuetify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuetify) dialogs and utility for raising snackbar alerts.
 
Adds the following methods to the Vue instance:

* `$alert( message )` 
    - An alert dialog. Returns Promise, resolved when the user accepts it.
    - `message` can be a string or an object with properties `{ text, title?, dialogMaxWidth?, acceptText?, 
    cancelText? }` where `title` becomes the dialog title, `text` becomes the message to display, and the other 
    properties control the appearance and behaviour of the dialog (see "Configurable properties" below). Applies to 
    `$confirm` and `$prompt` also (see below).
* `$confirm( message )` 
    - A confirmation dialog. Returns Promise, resolved if the user accepts it, rejected if the user cancels it.
* `$prompt( message )` 
    - A prompt dialog. Returns Promise, resolved with user input if user accepts it, rejected if the user cancels it.
* `$inform( message )` 
    - Raises a snackbar notification in the default colour.
    - `message` can be a string or an object with properties `{ text, color?, closeText?, snackbarX?, snackbarY?,
    snackbarTimeout? }` where `text` becomes the message to display, and the other properties control the appearance
    and behaviour of the snackbar (see "Configurable properties" below). Applies to `$warn` and `$error` also (see 
    below).
* `$warn( message )` 
    - Raises a snackbar notification in the warning colour.
* `$error( message )` 
    - Raises a snackbar notification in the error colour.

Based on [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuetify).

## Features

* Button labels localised to a large variety of languages (pull requests welcome) - Localisations for the buttons are
extracted from the [Dojo toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/) i18n.
* Allows you to inject your own button labels, overriding the defaults
* Various features of the dialogues and snackbars are configurable (e.g. dialog max width, snackbar location, colour, 
duration)

Full description and more examples accessible from home page served by `npm run serve`.

## Configurable properties

Various properties can be configured by handing them to Vue.use in the `options` argument when installing the plugin. 
(see **Usage examples** below). 

All of these are optional and have defaults:

* `locale` 
    - Locale for the button labels. Over 30 locales are supported. To override, see the properties below.
* `acceptText` 
    - Label for accept button in dialog
* `cancelText` 
    - Label for cancel button in dialog
* `closeText` 
    - Label for close button in snackbar message
* `snackbarX` 
    - Position of snackbar message: "left" or "right"
* `snackbarY` 
    - Position of snackbar message: "top" or "bottom"
* `snackbarTimeout` 
    - Snackbar duration in milliseconds
* `dialogMaxWidth` 
    - Max width of dialog in pixels
* `snackbarParent` 
    - ID of parent node in which the dialogs are mounted, default is "app"

## Usage examples

To install and configure the plugin:

```
import Vue from "vue";
import DialogPromise from "vuetify-dialog-promise";

Vue.use( DialogPromise, {
    locale : "fi",
    snackbarX : "left",
    snackbarY : "bottom"
} );
```

To use the plugin from inside your own component:

```
// Message with defaults
this.$alert( "Your mother is a hamster and your father smells of elderberries." );

// Confirmation with property overrides
this.$confirm( { 
    title : "Are you a witch?", 
    text : "Do you weigh less than a duck?", 
    acceptText : "I float", 
    cancelText : "I sink"
 } ).then( y => this.burnTheWitch() ).catch( n => this.notAWitch() );
 
// Prompt for value
this.$prompt( "What is your quest?" ).then( quest => 
    this.beginQuest( quest ).catch( n => {} );
    
// Snackbar notification with defaults    
this.$inform( "We are the knights that say Ni." );

// Snackbar notification with overrides
this.$inform( { text : "My favourite colour is blue.", color : "blue" } );
```

If used in a Vue-CLI project, this will be baked into your layer without you having to do anything.
